# AMPonent Parcel Template

`npm run dev` starts a development server

`npm run build` builds final project in dist folder

Documentation for AMPonent => https://github.com/AlexMercedCoder/Ponent

- Keep in mind components made with the AMPonent use the shawdow dom so you'll need to create the styling from within the shadow dom (style tags or link tags that import a css file). With Parcel, the bundler, Sass is not possible in web components
